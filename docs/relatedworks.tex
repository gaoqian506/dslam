\section{ORB SLAM}

\subsection{Introduction}

Bundle adjustment is known to provide accurate extimates of camera localization as well as a sparse geometrical reconstruction.

Contributions:\\
1. Use of the same features for all tasks;\\
2. Real time operation of large environment;\\
3. Real time loop closing based on optimization of a pose graph;\\
4. Real time relocalization with signifiant invariance to viewport and illumination;\\
5. A new automatic and robust initialization procedure based on model selection that permits to create an initial map of planar and non-planar scene;\\
6. A survival of fittest approach to map point and keyframe selection that is generous in spawning but very restrictive in culling.
