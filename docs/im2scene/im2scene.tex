\section{Related Works}

\cite{Saxena2009Make3D} use a markov random field (MRF) estimating detailed 3-d structure from a single still image of an unstructured environment. \cite{choy20163d} learns a mapping from images of objects to their underlying 3D shapes from a large collection of synthetic data using 3D-Convolutional LSTM which allows attention mechanism to focus on visible parts in 3D. \cite{Sinha2017SurfNet} study the problem of directly generating the 3D shape surface of rigid and non-rigid shapes using deep convolutional neural networks. \cite{Yang2016Real}  consider the problem of understanding the 3D layout of indoor corridor scenes from a single image in real time. \cite{Isola2016Image} investigate conditional adversarial networks as a general-purpose solution to image-to-image translation problems. \cite{Zhu2017Unpaired} present an approach for learning to translate an image from a source domain X to a target domain Y in the absence of paired examples.
